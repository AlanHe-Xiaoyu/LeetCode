# Tell me about a project you are proud of, including both your contributions and the surrounding team contributions

### Good Signals

* Should be a balance between their contributions and the teams.
* They should give some semblance of credit to others and/or a larger team.
* Important to mention the term team! During interviews people try to sell themselves, if no mention of team concerned that the interviewee won’t bring other people along in successes.
* Willingness to ask for help and get feedback from others.

### Bad Signals

* Doesn’t delegate and wants to do everything their own.
* Doesn’t share credit for a team efforts; too ‘me’ focused.
