# Describe something you've built

## Prompt

### "Describe a challenging project you built from scratch"

This question is designed for candidates to showcase their expertise. However, it is not a quiz or a checklist of topics to cover. It’s a technical dialogue in which to explore a thin but deep slice of the candidate’s knowledge, from which we can hopefully extrapolate the full breadth of their experience.

As they talk about the project, identify topics where you have common ground. Ask probing questions on these subjects to validate the candidate’s depth. If shared experience is scarce, or you’re interested in evaluating the candidate’s communication/teaching skills, you might ask the candidate to explain something that you’re unfamiliar with.

### Example Follow-Up Questions
These questions are general enough to get a discussion going, but feel free to follow the course of the conversation rather than trying to ask each of these.

#### Scope / complexity
* What were the challenges and constraints? E.g. scalability, performance, new technology, hard problems, etc.

#### Depth and Breadth
* What factors they considered when designing the system architecture
* About an unexpected technical issue they encountered*
* Factual questions about technology in use (to validate their knowledge)

#### Trade-Offs
* How they chose a technology or approach
* Why they chose it over any alternatives considered
* Whether it worked out as envisioned, or if they would change their decision
* What trade-offs did you consider in that decision?

#### Teaching/Communication
* I’m not familiar with that technology/concept/approach, can you explain?

#### Learning
* What surprising technical thing they learned
* What would you change?

## Scoring Rubric

### Unfamiliar
* Owned only a small or straightforward project, e.g. a well-defined part of a feature within an existing structure, or a simple side-project.
* Describes approaches and technology used in the project, but cannot articulate why they were chosen, identify alternatives, or discuss trade-offs.
* Displays surface-level knowledge of tooling and technologies, but lacks under-the-hood understanding of how they work and might need guidance in their application.
* May lack opinions on testing and maintainability
* Should be able to discuss something they learned from the project.

### Familiar
* Owned a medium-sized or moderately-complex project, e.g. an entire feature spanning multiple levels of the stack.
* Describes approaches and technology used in the project, with some awareness of the wider landscape, perhaps mentioning alternatives but unable to articulate trade-offs.
* Displays comfort in applying the relevant tooling and technologies, with some knowledge of the internals or advanced usage.
* Should be able to discuss something they learned from the project

### Proficient
* Has owned large and/or complicated projects, from concept to execution.
* Well-versed in the technology and approaches used in the project, knowledgeable about advanced usage as well as alternatives and their trade-offs.
* They should discuss the key decisions and trade-offs therein as well as talk in-depth about any particular facet of the project.
* Should be able to discuss something they learned from the project.

### Mastery
* Has owned entire initiatives, possibly spanning multiple interlocking “projects”, from concept to execution.
* Their knowledge encompasses both the high-level architecture as well as the nitty-gritty details.
* They should discuss the key decisions and trade-offs therein as well as talk in-depth about any particular facet of the project.
* Their awareness and expertise extends to the tooling used in the project.
* Able to explain and teach parts of the project.
